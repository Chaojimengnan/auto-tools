# auto-tools

This is an automated tool library I wrote, such as automatic input mouse information and keyboard information, free hands, improve efficiency. It was inspired by [pyautogui](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui). More automated tools will be added later.

Third party library use:
- gtest
- opencv
- my-windows

Currently it only supports Windows because I haven't learned the Linux API yet. Linux support is intended to be updated in the future.
